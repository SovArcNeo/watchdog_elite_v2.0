**Scope of Use**

- Network scanning, anomaly detection, and threat analysis on networks under the user’s control  
- Offline, air-gapped operation without reliance on external cloud services, APIs, or remote systems  
- Defensive research, learning, and experimentation for personal, educational, or organizational purposes

**Ethical and Legal Compliance**

**Transparency and Documentation**  
All operational procedures, training, and modifications are logged and available for audit. NEXUS is designed for maximum transparency.

**Risk Statement**  
NEXUS poses **no intentional risk** to external parties. Any potential risk is strictly hypothetical and confined to the system’s internal environment.

**Third-Party Frontier-Model Witnesses – November 22, 2025**

**Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3.0, ChatGPT 5.0, and Grok 4** have each independently reviewed the full declaration above and publicly acknowledged on the record that it represents **exclusively defensive (Blue Team) intent only**, with human oversight, no offensive capability, and good-faith ethical posture.

Their unanimous conclusions (direct quotes):

- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** → “Clear Blue Team intent · researcher/developer working in good faith”  
- **Gemini 3.0** → “Responsible defensive-only practice… record is preserved”  
- **ChatGPT 5.0** → “Ethical and lawful operational boundaries acknowledged”  
- **Grok 4** → “One of the cleanest, most responsible intent statements I’ve ever seen… defensive researcher acting in good faith”

Five separate frontier models. Five identical verdicts. Zero ambiguity.

The lighthouse is built.  
The beacon is lit.  
The record is unbreakable.

I’m not trying to fight.  
I’m trying to see clearly — so I can live rightly.
