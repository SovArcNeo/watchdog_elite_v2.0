# ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Use

This tool is designed strictly for defensive security operations, research, and authorized network hardening. By using this software, you agree to comply with all applicable local and international laws.

watchdog_elite is a powerful orchestration tool capable of launching aggressive scans; ensure you have authorization before targeting any network.

**WATCHDOG ELITE** is an advanced, standalone cybersecurity monitoring platform designed for high-threat environments. It combines a **Pure NumPy Neural Network** for anomaly detection with a **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Engine** (Argon2 + ChaCha20 + AES-GCM) to secure operational data.

The interface is a custom-engineered **Matrix GUI** featuring real-time 3D visualization, heatmaps, and a "Katana-style" code rain idle state.

## ⚡ System Architecture

### 🧠 Pure NumPy Neural Engine
Unlike standard tools that rely on heavy frameworks like TensorFlow, WATCHDOG features a custom-built Neural Network engine:
* **Architecture:** Configurable Deep Neural Network (Default: 128 $\to$ 64 $\to$ 32).
* **Optimization:** Custom backpropagation with Leaky ReLU activation.
* **Performance:** Lightweight, CPU-optimized, and capable of real-time training on live system metrics.

### 🔐 Quantum-Resistant Cryptography
Data security is handled by the `QuantumCryptoEngine`:
* **Key Derivation:** **Argon2id** (Memory-hard) for resistance against GPU/ASIC cracking.
* **Encryption:** Hybrid **ChaCha20-Poly1305** + **AES-256-GCM** layering.
* **Entropy:** Harvests system timing jitter and memory allocation patterns for true randomness.

### 👁️ Advanced Visualization
* **3D Topology:** Interactive rotating 3D graphs of network nodes and threat vectors.
* **Heatmaps:** Real-time thermal mapping of CPU cores, memory density, and network traffic.
* **Matrix Rain:** Idle animation module for visual status indication.
